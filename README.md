# ship.c
Assignment 4 from my Computer Organization and assembly class, the code in ship.c is mine, everything else is the given starter files. The goal of the assignment was to create a ship program in c that would navigate a "Zork" game. It is copy and pasted from private assignement files I can't publish, that is why there is no version history
